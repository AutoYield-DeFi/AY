You're absolutely right—since **rebalancing happens automatically**, there’s no need for a **Rebalance** button. That simplifies the interface and keeps it more user-friendly.

## **Detailed UI/UX Feedback & Wireframe Plan**
The **Portfolio Page** should be structured to ensure clarity, logical flow, and user-friendliness. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **📌 1. New Layout Plan**
Instead of the current structure where analytics are taking too much space, we will prioritize **user interactions at the top**, followed by analytics.

#### **🔹 Section 1: Portfolio Overview (Top)**
- **Key Focus:** Show the user's **active positions & available funds**.
- **Elements to Include:**
  - **User's Wallet Balance (SOL & USDC)**
  - **Total Portfolio Value (USD)**
  - **Active Liquidity Positions**
    - For each position:
      - Token Pair (e.g., **BONK/SOL**)
      - Status (e.g., **Active**, **Exited**, **AI Waiting**)
      - Total Funds Allocated
      - Fees Earned
      - Estimated APR
      - **Action Buttons:**
        - **Withdraw Liquidity**
        - **Manually Enter Position (only if AI exited)**
        - (Rebalancing happens automatically, so no button for that)

---

#### **🔹 Section 2: AI Decision Summary (Middle)**
- **Key Focus:** Transparency—explain AI’s actions.
- **Elements to Include:**
  - **Why AI Exited/Entered a Position**
  - **Recent AI Actions (Last 3 decisions)**:
    - Example: `"Exited BONK/SOL due to low trading volume. Funds converted to SOL."`
  - **Projected Next Move (if applicable)**

---

#### **🔹 Section 3: Analytics & Performance History (Bottom)**
- **Key Focus:** Data-driven insights for users who want detailed tracking.
- **Elements to Include:**
  - **Portfolio Growth Chart** (Total Value Over Time)
  - **Historical AI Trades**
  - **Yield Earned Breakdown (Fees Earned, APR Performance, etc.)**
  - **Liquidity Pool Trends (e.g., Best Performing Pairs)**

## **🖥️ Wireframe UI Mockup**
Now, I will generate a UI wireframe based on this structure. Give me a moment. ⏳

### **🛠️ Explanation of the UI Wireframe**
This **React-based wireframe** follows the **new layout plan** with logical structuring:

1. **📌 Portfolio Overview (Top)**
   - Shows **total funds, available balance**, and **active liquidity positions**.
   - Each position includes:
     - **Status (Active/Exited)**
     - **Funds allocated**
     - **Fees earned**
     - **APR**
     - **Withdraw button** for active positions.
     - **"Re-enter Position" button** for exited positions.

2. **📌 AI Decision Summary (Middle)**
   - Displays **recent AI actions** in a simple, user-friendly list.
   - Helps users **understand why positions changed**.

3. **📌 Portfolio Performance Analytics (Bottom)**
   - **Interactive line chart** to visualize **total portfolio value over time**.
   - More analytics can be added if needed.

### **🔄 Next Steps**
- **You can directly copy-paste this React code into Replit AI**.
- Adjust styling to match your **brand identity**.
- Add **real backend data** (instead of mock data) to make it functional.

Would you like me to refine any part of this wireframe further? 🚀
